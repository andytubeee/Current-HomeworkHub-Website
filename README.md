Hi, we're the HomeworkHub, a youth orchestrated free after school tutoring club! HomeworkHub provides Elementary school students with FREE tutoring sessions and volunteer tutors with community service hours, all from the comfort and safety of your own homes!
We understand how hard it is for younger students to adapt and keep up with the virtual and distance learning methods. We also know how limited and difficult volunteer opportunities are to find for those who want to help the community. We are dedicated to helping people who are currently facing those problems through our services! Together, we can work towards improving the community and getting through these tough times!
